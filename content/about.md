# Esports at WPI
WPI has been competing in esports for over 6 years in a wide range of titles. We currently support 11 games with over 150 members participating on teams. We also find opportunities for members to get involved in other areas of esports like broadcasting, coaching, or managing teams. We're always looking to build on our teams and the opportunities we provide to WPI students.
